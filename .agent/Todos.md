Gaps & TODOs

  • No .env.example found - confirm if secrets/env vars needed
  • MCP server runs as primary interface - verify startup
  requirements
  • CI includes Python 3.9 but project requires 3.10+ -
  version mismatch
  • No pre-commit hooks detected - could add for quality gates
  • Package structure has many modules (contract, context,
  enforce, etc.) - verify active usage
